# [Scripting] Web Scripting using Python

IP: 10.10.24.3

Advent of Cyber 2:

## Description:
- `Santa has a webpage at 10.10.24.3/static/index.html to help lost elves find their way home. Santa never told the elves what port number the webserver is on. Can you find out?!`
- `This webpage has a link somewhere on it, hidden away so anyone that isn't an elf can't find it.`
- `Santa's Sled has an API we can talk too. The key for the API is between 0 and 100, and it's an odd number. But be careful! After an unknown number of attempts, Santa's Sled will ban your IP address. `
